Python HelpSpot API
-------------------

A Python module for talking to HelpSpot via its [Web Services API]
(http://www.userscape.com/helpdesk/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=28).

For usage, see the docstring in the helpspot/api.py file.

Design Note
-----------

I wanted this to be lightweight and dynamic so I choose to hard code as little as possible about the HelpSpot API
in this module. It is up to you to figure out what arguments to send to HelpSpot and to decode its responses.

I welcome your feedback.
